DevNewsReader
=============
Dev News Reader is a demo aimed at showing why you should consider writing a web app rather than a native mobile app for each platform.

You can (usually) find the current version at http://www.devnewsreader.com.

Functionality
-------------
Currently, the app:

1.  Uses knockout.js for data binding
2.  Uses CSS3 media queries for styling on different devices
3.  Calls an unofficial Hacker News API to retrieve stories

Future Functions
----------------

1.  More data sources (e.g. /r/programming)
2.  More creative CSS styling
3.  Ability to read comments inline - different behaviour for different sized devices
